<h1>RuneScriptTS</h1>

A fork of [Neptune](https://github.com/neptune-ps/neptune) (a project undertaking modern OSRS), this project is instead entirely RuneScript-focused.

This is a work-in-progress effort to port [this](https://github.com/LostCityRS/RuneScriptKt) to run in TypeScript, and the upstream repo will be sunsetted in favor of this.
